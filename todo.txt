Properly Respond to Slack
- I only need to respond with the challenge body on setup?

Security & Authentication

Database
- Insert questions into rows
- App reads from rows and responds to original thread in a separate routine not related to ingestion


Handle Event
- Parse event from slack as JSON

Routing
- Math equation route
- Flip text route

Solve an equation and send the answer back to the channel, or flip the text backward
- Infer from text if it's a math problem or a text string to be flipped
